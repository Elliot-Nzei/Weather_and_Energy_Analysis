Part 3: Statistical Analysis 
 
Objective 
Uncover trends, patterns, and correlations between temperature and electricity usage. You Will Build 
 
src/analysis.py: Central module for correlation and pattern discovery 
Correlation analysis: Compute Pearson correlation and R-squared 
Temporal trend analysis: Weekly and seasonal trends 
Heatmap dataset preparation: Temperature vs weekday usage mapping 
 
 
Analytical Goals 
Determine correlation strength between temp and usage  
Measure city-by-city seasonal differences 
Detect weekend-vs-weekday usage trends 
Prepare datasets for heatmap visualizations 
 
 
Output Files  
data/analytics/ 
correlations.json — Correlation coefficients and R-squared per city 
timeseries.parquet — Joined daily time series for plotting 
heatmap.parquet — Average usage grouped by temp range and day 
summary_stats.json — Calculated insights and descriptive statistics
