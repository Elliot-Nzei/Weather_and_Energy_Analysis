# Video Presentation Script: US Weather and Energy Analysis

**Target Duration:** 3 minutes

---

### Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**(Scene: Start with a compelling visual, like a graph showing volatile energy prices or a map with extreme weather alerts.)**

**You:** Did you know that inaccurate energy forecasting costs companies millions of dollars every year? The weather plays a huge role in how much electricity we use, and getting those predictions wrong leads to wasted energy and financial losses.

**You:** That's the problem I set out to solve with this project. I've built an automated pipeline that analyzes the impact of weather on electricity demand in five major US cities, providing valuable insights to help energy companies make better decisions.

### Pipeline Walkthrough (0:30 - 2:00)

**(Scene: Transition to a screen recording of your code.)**

**You:** Let me walk you through how it works. The entire process is automated, from data collection to analysis and visualization.

#### Data Collection (0:30 - 1:00)

**You:** First, we need data. I'm fetching weather data from the NOAA API and energy data from the EIA API. This is done using a Python script that runs daily.

**(Show this code snippet from `src/data_fetcher.py`)**

```python
# src/data_fetcher.py
def get_weather_data(city, date, api_key):
    """Fetches weather data for a given city and date from the NOAA API."""
    # ... (API call logic) ...

def get_energy_data(city, date, api_key):
    """Fetches hourly energy demand data for a given city and date from EIA."""
    # ... (API call logic) ...
```

**You:** This script is designed to be robust, with error handling and retry logic to ensure we always have the most up-to-date data.

#### Data Processing and Quality (1:00 - 1:30)

**You:** Raw data is often messy, so the next step is to clean and process it. This is where we handle missing values, convert data types, and perform crucial data quality checks.

**(Show this code snippet from `src/quality_checks.py`)**

```python
# src/quality_checks.py
def perform_quality_checks(df):
    """Performs various quality checks on the merged DataFrame."""
    # ... (Outlier detection, staleness check, etc.) ...
    df['data_quality_score'] = ...
    return df
```

**You:** For example, I've implemented outlier detection to flag any unusual temperature readings or energy demand values. I also calculate a data quality score for each record, which helps us understand the reliability of our data.

#### Analysis and Insights (1:30 - 2:00)

**You:** Once the data is clean, we can start analyzing it. I'm using the SciPy library to perform statistical analysis, such as calculating the correlation between temperature and energy demand.

**(Show this code snippet from `src/analysis.py`)**

```python
# src/analysis.py
def analyze_data():
    """Performs statistical analysis on the merged and quality-checked data."""
    # ...
    for city in df['city'].unique():
        corr, _ = pearsonr(city_df['tmax_f'], city_df['demand_mwh'])
        r_squared = corr**2
        correlations[city] = {
            "pearson_correlation": corr,
            "r_squared": r_squared
        }
    # ...
```

**You:** This analysis helps us understand how strongly temperature affects energy consumption in different cities.

### Dashboard and Insights (2:00 - 2:30)

**(Scene: Transition to a screen recording of your Streamlit dashboard.)**

**You:** To make these insights accessible, I've built an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Here, you can explore the data, visualize trends, and see the results of the analysis in real-time.

**(Showcase the dashboard, highlighting the time series chart, correlation scatterplot, and heatmap.)**

**You:** For example, we can clearly see the strong positive correlation between extreme temperatures and energy demand, especially in cities like Phoenix during the summer. We can also see how energy usage patterns differ between weekdays and weekends.

### Conclusion (2:30 - 3:00)

**(Scene: Return to a view of you speaking.)**

**You:** In summary, this project provides a powerful tool for energy companies to improve their demand forecasting. By integrating weather and energy data, we can reduce waste, optimize power generation, and ultimately save money.

**You:** Future improvements could include incorporating more weather variables, adding more cities, and even building a predictive model to forecast energy demand.

**You:** Thank you for watching. I'm excited to see how this project can help create a more efficient and sustainable energy future.
