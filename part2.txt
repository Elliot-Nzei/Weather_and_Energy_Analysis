Part 2: Data Quality Assurance
Objective
Ensure data is clean, consistent, and usable for statistical analysis and visualization.
You Will Build
src/data_processor.py: Cleans and merges data
src/quality_checks.py: Contains quality check logic
Daily quality report written to data/processed/
Checks Performed
Missing data detection
Outlier detection (temps < -50°F or > 130°F, negative demand)
Staleness check: Flag records older than 48 hours
Synchronization: Ensure each city has data for the same date
Processing Steps
Convert temperature from tenths of Celsius to Fahrenheit
Merge weather and energy datasets using city/region-date as key
Generate and store data quality metrics and flags
Output Format
data/processed/merged_20240115.parquet
Columns: date, city, tmax_f, tmin_f, demand_mwh, is_outlier, data_quality_score
